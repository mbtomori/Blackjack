For our Blackjack project, we had our first meeting on Friday the 12th of March.
We set up our github repo and discussed he first part of the assignment where we were
required to create a card class, deck class and a hand class.

Alexander was responsible for the card class, Kristine was responsible for
the deck class while, Maria was responsible for the hand class.

We had a follow up meeting on the 19th of March to discuss the how to implement
the Blackjack game using our classes for the second part of the assignment.

For this second part, we decided to create an abstract player class;
which serves as the parent class for our dealer and the players in the
Array list, a model for the blackjack game and a controller view.

Alexander was responsible for the abstract player, Maria was responsible
for the controller and view, and Kristine was responsible for the BlackJack game model.

Each team member was also required to provide testing for all their class(es). We didn't
end up doing any automated testing of the view or controller, since we aren't sure how
to do that, so we did a lot of manual testing.

Throughout the project, we reviewed one another's pull requests and detailed provided
feedback to one another promptly to ensure an effective and beneficial work flow. Adequate help
was also given if requested.

Here's a map of our file structure. The model and view directories are packages.

- Run the program by calling main in the BlackJackController.java.
